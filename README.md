Bright Paper Werewolves
--------------------------------------
c'mon polluted eyeballs

stop scouting out the field

jump up bright paper werewolves

and everybody everywhere


anyone can scratch

and anyone can win

so bring out another batch


they want to get out of here

but they can't find the exit

they cling to the cinema

and they can't find security

then they finally got recognized

so they left in obscurity and misery
